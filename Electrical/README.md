## Coursework

ECE 298 Instrumentation and Prototyping
- Designed and manufactured a Boosterpack expansion board for TI MSP430 with Diptrace
- Developed feasibility model, schematic, and PCB layout, while documenting the process
- Assembled finished PCB using SMD components and reflow soldering techniques
- Implemented functions such as travel distance measurement, user input via keypad, and accurate instantaneous speed calculation in C through Code Composer Studio

## Boston Children's Hospital

- Reversed engineered and documented a microcontroller expansion board used to control a surgical implant robot designed treat esophageal atresia and short bowel syndrome in developing children
- Calculated resistor values needed in an instrumental amplifier circuit for force sensors
- Created custom schematic symbols and footprints for parts using Eagle
- Troubleshooted new boards to find an incorrectly mapped port breakout and fixed the issue
- Used Eagle to respin the old board layout and achieved a 30% size reduction while adding functionality
