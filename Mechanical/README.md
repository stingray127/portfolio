I was a primary mechanical designer for 3 years for my high school robotics team, and the lead mechanical designer for 2 years. In my last year on the team, we produced an internationally competitive robot, beating our competition through simple but focused mechanical design.

We modeled the entire robot, from gearboxes to screws, in large Solidworks assemblies. I can't say we used the best practices, but we did our best given our limited knowledge and 6 week build season.

I tried to rely on in house techniques as much as possible. As such, the only precision machining we needed on the 2017 robot was the milled holes for drivetrain and climber bearings in our aluminum 2x1 tubing. Everything else was designed around our limited in house manufacturing capabilities, and it came together beautifully.
